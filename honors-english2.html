    <section id="welcome">
      <h2>Welcome to English 2 Honors</h2>
      <p>English isn’t just about reading books and writing essays—it’s about learning to understand the world and express your voice in it. In English 2 Honors, you’ll dive into stories that aren’t just entertaining—they’re windows into different cultures, eras, and ideas. Each novel, play, and poem introduces you to new ways of thinking, helping you build empathy, sharpen your mind, and discover how powerful language can truly be.</p>
      <p>This class is where you start to see how writing isn’t just something you do for school—it’s something that shapes history, challenges injustice, inspires movements, and changes lives. You’ll learn how authors use their voices to reveal truths, stir emotions, and explore what it means to be human. And through writing your own essays, reflections, and analyses, you’ll sharpen your ability to argue, persuade, and articulate your thoughts with clarity and confidence.</p>
      <p>English 2 Honors doesn’t just prepare you for future classes—it prepares you for life. The skills you build here apply everywhere: whether you’re giving a speech, composing a thoughtful text, writing a college application, or simply trying to understand another person’s point of view. Strong reading and writing skills make you a better communicator, and in a world full of noise, being able to express yourself clearly is a superpower.</p>
      <p>But more than anything, this class is a chance to explore your own voice. What do you care about? What do you think? Literature challenges you to ask questions, think critically, and make connections between your experiences and the wider world. As you analyze themes, characters, and language, you’ll start to recognize parts of yourself in the stories—and maybe discover ideas you never expected.</p>
      <p>Whether you love reading already or think it’s not your thing, give this class a chance to surprise you. Find one passage that moves you. One line that sticks with you. One argument that makes you feel sharper. That’s where the spark starts.</p>
      <p>In English 2 Honors, you’re not just studying English. You’re developing the tools to think deeply, write powerfully, and connect with others in ways that matter.</p>
