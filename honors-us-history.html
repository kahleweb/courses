      <h2>Welcome to US History Honors</h2>
      <p>U.S. History Honors isn’t just about memorizing dates or names—it’s about discovering the story of how America became
        what it is today, and what that journey means for you. In this class, you’ll explore the triumphs, contradictions,
        struggles, and transformations that define the American experience. You’ll see that history isn’t frozen in
        textbooks—it’s alive, debated, and still unfolding.</p>

      <p>At its heart, U.S. History is about people—dreamers, rebels, leaders, workers, students—just like you. It’s about
        the hard choices they faced, the risks they took, and the values they fought for. From the birth of the Constitution
        to the Civil Rights Movement, from westward expansion to World Wars, each unit of history raises big questions:
        What does freedom mean? Who decides what’s fair? How do we make progress?</p>

      <p>This class gives you the tools to think critically and ask those big questions. You’ll analyze primary sources—
        actual letters, speeches, newspapers—and form your own interpretations. You’ll compare different viewpoints,
        examine cause and effect, and uncover how the past echoes in today’s headlines. In a world full of opinions,
        studying history trains you to seek truth through evidence.</p>

      <p>U.S. History also helps you see how you fit into the bigger picture. It shows that change doesn’t just happen—
        it’s made, often by young people with courage and conviction. The story of America is still being written, and
        understanding the past empowers you to shape what comes next. Whether you’re passionate about justice, science,
        the arts, or leadership, history gives context to your purpose.</p>

      <p>Yes, some parts of history are complicated, and others are painful—but facing those stories makes you wiser and
        more empathetic. It gives you a deeper appreciation for the freedoms you have, and a clearer vision of how to
        protect and improve them.</p>

      <p>In U.S. History Honors, you’re not just studying a subject—you’re stepping into a conversation about who we are,
        where we’ve been, and where we’re going. This class challenges you to think like a historian and speak like a
        citizen. And along the way, you’ll discover that the past is full of people who weren’t so different from you—
        students with big dreams and bold questions.</p>

    <section id="why-us-history-honors-matters">
      <h2>Why US History Honors Matters</h2>
      <p>US History Honors is more than a study of dates and events; it is an exploration of the ideas, struggles, and
        triumphs that have shaped the United States. Understanding history is essential for making sense of the present
        and preparing for the future. In this class, you will learn to think critically about the past, to analyze
        primary sources, and to draw connections between historical events and contemporary issues. These skills are
        invaluable for informed citizenship, personal growth, and professional success.</p>

      <p>History is not just about memorizing facts; it is about understanding the forces that drive change and the
        decisions that shape societies. By studying US history, you gain insight into the values, conflicts, and
        innovations that define the American experience. This knowledge helps you appreciate the complexity of the
        world and equips you to engage thoughtfully with current events.</p>

      <p>In US History Honors, you will explore key moments in American history, from the founding of the colonies to
        the civil rights movement and beyond. You will examine the contributions of diverse groups and individuals,
        recognizing the interconnectedness of social, political, and economic developments. This comprehensive approach
        fosters a deeper understanding of the nation's past and its implications for the future.</p>

      <p>Beyond the classroom, studying history develops critical thinking and analytical skills. As you evaluate
        evidence, construct arguments, and interpret perspectives, you learn to approach problems systematically and
        thoughtfully. These skills are transferable to any field and contribute to your overall intellectual growth.
      </p>

      <p>US History Honors also cultivates empathy and cultural awareness. By examining the experiences of people from
        different backgrounds, you develop a greater appreciation for diversity and a commitment to equity and justice.
        This understanding is essential for building inclusive communities and addressing global challenges.</p>

      <p>Perhaps most importantly, studying history inspires curiosity and a sense of purpose. It challenges you to ask
        questions, seek answers, and consider your role in shaping the future. This journey of discovery fosters
        resilience, adaptability, and a lifelong love of learning.</p>

      <p>As you progress through US History Honors, remember that history is not just about the past; it is about

      <h2>Periods of US History (with Films)</h2>

   
        <h3>Pre-Colonial & Early Contact</h3>
        <p>Before European exploration, North America was home to diverse indigenous civilizations with complex societies, trade networks, and spiritual systems. Groups like the Iroquois, Pueblo, Mississippian, and others thrived with unique cultural identities. European contact, beginning with explorers like Columbus and continuing with Spanish, French, and English expeditions, had profound effects — spreading diseases, initiating trade, and beginning cycles of displacement and violence. This period introduces students to the foundational stories of both Native Americans and the European empires that would contest for control of the continent.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>500 Nations (1995, TV-PG)</li>
          <li>America Before Columbus (2009, TV-PG)</li>
          <li>Apocalypto (2006, R)</li>
          <li>Black Robe (1991, R)</li>
          <li>The New World (2005, PG-13)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Colonial America & Revolution</h3>
        <p>From the early 1600s through the 1770s, English settlers established colonies along the eastern seaboard, developing economies and local governments. Tensions with Britain grew due to taxation, trade restrictions, and lack of representation, leading to protest and, eventually, rebellion. The American Revolution (1775–1783) resulted in independence and launched the U.S. into nationhood. Key figures like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton helped shape the early republic’s values and political institutions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hamilton (2020, PG-13)</li>
          <li>John Adams (2008, TV-14)</li>
          <li>The Patriot (2000, R)</li>
          <li>The War That Made America (2006, TV-PG)</li>
          <li>The Last of the Mohicans (1992, R)</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h3>Westward Expansion & Manifest Destiny</h3>
        <p>
            The 19th century was marked by U.S. expansion westward, driven by the belief in Manifest Destiny — the idea that Americans were destined to spread across the continent. Events like the Louisiana Purchase, Mexican-American War, and Indian Removal Act facilitated territorial growth but devastated Native communities. Railroads, homesteading, and the Gold Rush reshaped the landscape. This era includes triumphs of settlement but also the darker legacies of displacement and cultural erasure.
        </p>

          <li>Far and Away (1992, PG-13)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Slavery to Reconstruction</h3>
        <p>
            Slavery was central to the economy and society of the American South. The abolitionist movement gained strength in the 1800s, culminating in the Civil War (1861–1865). Following Union victory, the Reconstruction era (1865–1877) attempted to reunite the country and secure civil rights for freedmen. Constitutional amendments abolished slavery and granted citizenship and voting rights, but systemic racism and violent backlash undermined long-term progress, setting the stage for Jim Crow laws.

          <li>Amistad (1997, R)</li>    
          <li>The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1974, TV-PG)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Civil War</h3>
        <p>
            The Civil War was the bloodiest conflict in U.S. history, fought between the Union and Confederacy over slavery and states’ rights. Major battles like Gettysburg and Antietam, and leaders like Lincoln, Grant, and Lee, shaped the outcome. The war preserved the Union and ended slavery but left deep national scars. Understanding this war is crucial to grasping the origins of racial and regional divisions that persist today.
        </p>

          <li>Lincoln (2012, PG-13)</li>

          <li>Glory (1989, R)</li>
          <li>Ken Burns: The Civil War (1990, TV-PG)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reconstruction</h3>
        <p>
            After the Civil War, the U.S. faced the daunting task of reunifying and redefining itself. Reconstruction policies aimed to rebuild the South and integrate formerly enslaved people into society. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were transformative, but Reconstruction was short-lived. Federal troops eventually withdrew, and white supremacist groups reasserted control. This period set up the struggles of the Jim Crow era and the long fight for civil rights.

        <ul>
          <li>Slavery by Another Name (2012, TV-PG)</li>
          <li>Freedom: A History of US (2003, TV-PG)</li>
          <li>PBS: Reconstruction: America After the Civil War (2019, TV-PG)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Gilded Age</h3>
        <p>
            Spanning the late 1800s, the Gilded Age saw explosive industrial growth, urbanization, and immigration. Wealthy tycoons like Carnegie and Rockefeller dominated industries while workers faced poor conditions, sparking the rise of labor movements. Corruption plagued politics, and vast inequality characterized the era. Despite its name, the period’s “gilded” surface masked serious social issues that would lead to reforms in the Progressive Era.

          <li>An American Experience: The Rockefellers (1999, TV-PG)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>World War I & 1920s</h3>
        <p>
            The U.S. entered World War I in 1917, helping the Allies win. The war reshaped the global order and led to isolationist sentiment at home. The 1920s were a time of cultural transformation: jazz flourished, women gained the right to vote, and consumerism rose. But nativism, Prohibition, and racial tensions also defined the decade, making it both exciting and volatile.
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>American Experience: The Great War (2017, TV-PG)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Great Depression</h3>
        <p>
            After the stock market crash of 1929, the U.S. entered a deep economic crisis. Unemployment soared, banks failed, and families lost homes and livelihoods. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal introduced social programs and regulations to stabilize the economy and support citizens. The Depression reshaped the role of government and is a critical lens for understanding economic policy and reform movements.

          <li>Seabiscuit (2003, PG-13)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>World War II</h3>
        <p>
            America’s involvement in World War II (1941–1945) began after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S. fought on two fronts — Europe and the Pacific — and played a decisive role in defeating the Axis Powers. The war mobilized the entire population, including women and minorities, and spurred technological and industrial growth. The Holocaust, atomic bomb, and the birth of the United Nations all marked this turning point in global history.

        </ul>
        <h3>Cold War</h3>
        <p>
            From 1945 to 1991, the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in a tense ideological rivalry. The Cold War shaped foreign and domestic policies through events like the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Space Race. Fear of communism influenced politics, education, and culture. Though there was little direct combat between the superpowers, proxy wars and nuclear threats made this one of the most dangerous periods in modern history.

        </ul>

        <h3>Civil Rights & Social Movements</h3>
        <p>The mid-20th century saw a surge in activism to expand rights for African Americans, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and workers. Landmark victories like Brown v. Board of Education and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 helped dismantle segregation. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and others led grassroots movements that challenged deeply rooted injustice. These decades reshaped American identity and law.</p>

        <h3>1970s & Vietnam Era</h3>
        <p>
            The Vietnam War divided the nation, prompting massive protests and reshaping Americans’ trust in government. Simultaneously, the 1970s brought political upheaval with the Watergate scandal, economic troubles like stagflation, and cultural shifts in music, art, and attitudes toward authority. This was a time of reckoning and transformation that redefined what it meant to be American.
